wordpressPlugin_ImageWall
=========================

#What is it?
It's the copy of this plugin: [http://www.themodernnomad.com/image-wall-plugin/](http://www.themodernnomad.com/image-wall-plugin/), but with some added functionalities that I use in some wordpress site.
I hope that this functionalities can be useful for many other people.

In particular these are the new functionalities:

#==2.15==
**link_to_image**: Add link to image instead the page url. This is usefult if you use a lightbox plugin. In this case, when you click on an image, the lightbox box will appear.

**only_this_page**: Force to add images to the wall only from this page.

**only_pages_number**: Force to add images only from this list of pages ID. You can add multiple pages separated by commas. This is useful for filter images from some posts. 
Example: 
```[image_wall image_sizes="medium , large" column_proportion_restrictions="2.0" support_author="true" move_to_end="true" only_pages_number="20,21,23,100"]```

#==2.10, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7==
**only_pages_number**: Force to add images only from this list of pages ID. You can add multiple pages separated by commas. This is useful for filter images from some posts.
